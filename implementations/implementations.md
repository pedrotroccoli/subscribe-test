## Implementatins

I decided to keep all the implementations of `domain` and the applicable classes in this folder.

I created some files and I'll give you the reason for it.

1. BasicPrinter - Uses the `ReceiptPrinter` class and do the print of the checkout items accordingly with the problem statement outputs.
2. ImportDuty - Uses the `TaxBase` and implement the import tax based on the problem statement rules.
3. BasicSales - Uses the `TaxBase` and implement the basic sales tax accordingly with the problem statement rules.
